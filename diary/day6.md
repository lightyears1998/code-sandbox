# Day 6

First time use Linux to edit a file. No diary for yesterday and the day before yseterday because... no Internet...

and no Linux.

I can't use Pinyin to input!!!

It has been a pleasure to be in GZHU, and I believe future will be fine. Meeting new friends, new classmates, picking classes tommorrow...

What a great time...
